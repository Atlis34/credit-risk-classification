# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 challenge

All code was written and tested by myself, Ryan MacFarlane. No tutor was used this week, but I did receive help and guidance from the Xpert Learning AI Assistant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All code was written in Visual Studio Code and the Credit Risk Analysis Report was put together using Microsoft Word.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both the Jupyter Notebook script, and the Analysis report can be found in the 'Credit_Risk' folder.

Thank you for reading and grading!
